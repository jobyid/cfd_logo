So here is the idea:
We are looking to create a machine learning or AI model which preditcs the close price of the FTSE 100 for a given day
It is often suggested that the markets run on emotions, so I wonder how weather, day of the week, month and the moon
could effect these emotions and therefore if the FTSE closes up or down on the day.

Version 1:
Takes the following
    - Previous day, O,H,L,C
    - Day of the week
    - Month
    - Moon Illumination
    - Moon Distance
    - Temperature
    - Rain Fall
    - Sunshine hrs
